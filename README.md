# HumTech Repository

The purpose of the Humanitarian Repository is to create a central location that collects easily customizable and re-usable scripts of computer code for the purpose of advancing humanitarian research. Our goal is for TU Delft students to collectively build a library of tools that can help innovate research in the humanitarian sector. Students can contribute to this project by recycling their old programs in a way that gives back to the global community, or by writing new and innovative programs. These scripts are made in a variety of programming languages and are designed to be customizable, such that they can be re-used by students and researchers to quickly gather and analyze data when the next series of disasters strike. Students may also download these codes to use for their own research; or build upon and enhance code that has been written by another. Together, we aim to share code in a way that helps crowdsource solutions to the world’s biggest emergencies. 

## Getting Started

1. View the "Getting Started" folder for a Jupyter template. The template shows some best practices of how your code should be formatted (i.e. with lots of comments) so that others can understand, adapt, reproduce your work. 
2. In the "Getting Started" folder there is file called "HDX Overview." HDX is a standard for how to format csv files to comply with the United Nations standard. Volunteers who contribute data files that comply with the HDX standard will have their contributions uploaded to the UN OCHA system (https://data.humdata.org/). 
3. Need ideas on what kinds of to work on? See the "Inspiration" section below for some topics in high demand.

## Inspiration

If you would like to contribute your skills to this project but are unsure of what scripts are needed, below is a list of some topics that are at the forefront of humanitarian research. 
* Studying movement of the affected population. For example, in an Ebola outbreak it can be highly useful to know the local patterns of movement in order to understand how the virus may spread. Can you use mobile phone data or other information to show how people move?
* Other
* For more ideas, try searching “humanitarian” in GitHub to get inspiration from what others are working on

## Motivation

Volunteers who contribute excellent work to the repository will be featured on the HumTech Lab website (www.tudelft.nl/humtechlab) and recognized at other promotional events. 

## Community

Feel free to join our Slack channel at (humaidtpm.slack.com) to contribute your insight and questions to the conversation. The HumTech Lab holds regular meetings which you can attend to see what TU Delft researchers are working on. You can also follow the HumTech Lab on Twitter for more opportunities to get involved. 


## Thesis Circle 

MSc students who are interested in working on a humanitarian or disaster-related topic in greater depth are invited to participate in the HumTech Thesis Circle. These students use their thesis project as an opportunity to connect with field practitioners and innovate resarch in the humanitarian sector
